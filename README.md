# Vapor Liquid Equilibrium Calculations
## Jacob Albrecht

This project uses the UNIFAC Structural Groups found [here](http://www.aim.env.uea.ac.uk/aim/info/UNIFACgroups.html) to calculate vapor-liquid equilibrium for a binary mixture of common solvents.

To use: select species fraction in a mixture, pressure and temperature.  A Txy diagram can then be calculated.
